# sklep-django
My first ecommerce shop, no payment option implemented.
User interface may need some refurbishment, i haven't learned any frontend frameworks yet, might upgrade it in future.
I focused on usability and as clean (as i can make) backend, but it's my first bigger django app and some things might need to be done differently.
